# Kasparro Agentic FB Analyst

This project implements a **multi-agent AI system** that analyzes Facebook Ads performance, detects ROAS/CTR declines, validates hypotheses, and generates creative recommendations along with a marketer-friendly final report.

## 📦 Features
- Agentic pipeline (Planner → Insight → Evaluator → Creative)
- ROAS/CTR analysis using real FB ads data
- Hypothesis generation + quantitative validation
- Creative recommendations for low-performing campaigns
- Detailed marketing report (`report.md`)
- Structured logs for agent traceability (`logs/`)
- Works entirely offline on CSV data

```

### **2. Create & activate virtual environment (Windows)**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.\\.venv\\Scripts\\activate
```

### **3. Install dependencies**

# 🧠 System Architecture (Agent Workflow)

Below is the multi-agent workflow used in this project:

```
User Task ("Analyze ROAS drop")
        │
        ▼
📌 Planner Agent
- Decomposes the task
- Selects campaigns with ROAS drop
        │
        ▼
📌 Insight Agent
- Generates hypotheses from time-series data
        │
        ▼
📌 Evaluator Agent
- Validates hypotheses with pre/post metrics
- Adds confidence & evidence
        │
        ▼
📌 Creative Agent
- Generates creative recommendations
        │
        ▼
📌 Report Generator
- Builds final summary report for marketers
```

# 🔍 Validation Layer Description

### The **EvaluatorAgent** validates hypotheses using:
#### ✔ ROAS validation:
- Splits time-series into two halves  
- Computes mean ROAS (pre vs post)  
- Calculates % drop  
- Assigns confidence level  

#### ✔ CTR validation:
- Compares CTR vectors  
- Adds quantitative evidence  

### Why it matters:
- Prevents hallucinated insights  
- Ensures all results are data-driven  
- Matches assignment rubric (20% validation weight)
